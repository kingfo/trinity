h1. AsUnit 2

This build of the AsUnit framework is intended to work with ActionScript 2 as it appeared in Flash Player 6.

ActionScript 2 was quickly improved for Flash Players 7, 8 and Flash Lite 2.0, and if you're developing for those platforms, please use the as25 branch found nearby, as that framework is much more robust and mature.
